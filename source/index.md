# Introduction
Welcome to the Maera Restuarant documentation.  We will help you understand how the shell works, what plugins will be required,
how to build your front page, and how to use the restaurant functionality.

# Shell Logic
Maera Restaurant uses five, front-page, widgetized sections that allow you to build in your content how you see fit.  What makes
this exceptional, is that when coupled with the Maera widget class, you can specify how much area is used by your widgets.  You can then build in content as you like.   We have included a fallback to include the latest posts on the front page in case you haven't added any widgets yet.

Maera Restaurant comes with two brand new widgets; the new slider widget, built using Timber/Twig, and with its own custom post type, and also the menu widget.  This is not to be confused with navigation menus, but rather food menu (items).

<aside class="notice">Maera Restaurant also uses the standard Maera actions and filters for injecting and handling content, and how data is displayed.  You can read more about them <a href="https://github.com/presscodes/maera/wiki" target="_blank">here</a>, or inside your theme's documentation under Appearance > Theme Options, and selecting the "Documentation" tab.</aside>

<aside class="warning">This documentation is considered incomplete until the project is more mature, and is subject to change</aside>
