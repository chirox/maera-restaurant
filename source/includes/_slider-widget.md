# Slider Widget
The Maera Slider widget will allow you to add as many slides as you like, and place them wherever desired.  The slider uses its own custom post type coupled with Advanced Custom Fields to allow for multiple images and text within the slider.

The slider also uses CSS3 animations, which keeps the codebase much lighter.

## How to use the slider Widget

```shell
Slides > Add New Slide
```

1.  Create a new slider post using the standard WordPress post interface.

2.  Add an image to use for the background of the slider.

3.  Add a second image to use for the overlay.  If you do not select an image to use, the slider title and text will span the full width instead.

4.  Add a title for the slide to use for the main text, and add an excerpt to use for the secondary text of the slider.

5.  Add the slider widget using the standard WordPress widget interface.

6.  Set the options for the slider widget such as how many slides to display, whether or not to offset, the interval at which the slides cycle, pause on mouse hover, continuous cycle, parallax, or enabling/disabling the overlay image.
