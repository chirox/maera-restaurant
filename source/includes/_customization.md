## Restaurant Customization
We have added a few options that will let you change the currency type, contact information, as well as the recent blog posts text, which could help restaurants better define their branding.

## Layout Customization
You can select between a wide layout, a layout to include a sidebar.  The front page sections are toggleable, (on/off), and can be rearranged above or below each other.  To enable a section, click the "Eye" on the left of the section to enable, then use the handles on the right to move the sections around as you please.  Your changes are reflected immediately in the customizer window.

You can also enable or disable breadcrumbs should you desire.

## Color Customization
You can select a few colors to use throughout the site, such as the primary brand color, link color (static and over), as well as the color of the navigation bar. We also included custom color calculations which can handle some of the color for you.  When enabling automatic color calculations, any text and links are automatically generated to be a contrasting color of what the background color of the section is set to be.

Say, for example, you set Section 1 to have a dark background color (covered later), and have automatic color calculations enabled, the text displayed in section 1 will be of a contrastinc color, such as white/off-white.  Link colors will also adapt.  The same applies for any color set on the navigation menu.

If you enable automatic color calculations, some other color options will be disabled.

## Typography Customization
The typography options allow you to set the body, header (H1, H2, H3, etc) and content font, colors, size and weights. The fonts available are from Google Fonts, and will be provided in a list for you to choose.  If you need to use a brand specific font, you will need to add them to your CSS.

## Section Customization
Using the Section customization options, you can create a beautiful parallax site, or even a site with very distinctive sections.  You can specify a background for each section, and whether or not that parallax for the section is enabled. When enabling parallax, the background of the section is automatically specified, so you don't have to worry about proper positioning.  Just upload a high quality image that is decently sized, enable Parallax and you're set.  You can even combine this semi-transparent PNG's and background colors, allowing for more granular parllax control.
