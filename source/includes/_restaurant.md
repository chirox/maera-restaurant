## Restaurant Plugin
The Maera Restaurant Shell requires the WordPress [Restaurant plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/restaurant/) by [Justin Tadlock](https://profiles.wordpress.org/greenshady/).  Using this as the core, we can quickly and easily extend it to allow for an array of extra functionality which is included in the Maera Restaurant shell. By default, you can specify menu item tags, such as if an item is gluten free, a chef's special, etc.  With Maera Restaurant, we have added in additional fields which allow you to specify the menu item section, such as Dessert, Main Courses, or Appetizers.

### How to use the Restaurant Plugin
```shell
Restaurant > Add Menu Item
```

1.  Create a new menu item  using the standard WordPress post interface.

2.  Enter a title for your menu item, as well as a description.  Since food item descriptions tend to run on the shoter side, it is probably wholly uneccessary to use the post excerpt.  However, you may do so if you desire.  Also, if your description runs long, Maera Restaurant will handle the excerpt for you automatically.

3.  Enter a price, menu section (required/recommended), menu tags (if desired), and an image to use for the image, (if desired/recommended).

Once you have entered the information, save your post and it will then be ready for display in the restaurant menu.
