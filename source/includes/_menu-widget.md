For example, if you would like the widget to take up 1/3 of the space it is in, set the widget width to 4/12.  If you would like the widget to take up half the space it is in, set the widget width to 6/12.  If you would like the widget to take up the full space it is in, set it to 12/12.  Additionally, if you would like the widget to stretch past its boundaries and take up the full window width, specify Full Width.

Save your options and your menu is now on display.
